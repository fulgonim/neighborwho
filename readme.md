NeighborWho
Thinkful Capstone Project #1

Introduction:

Neighborwho allows users to search for a residential New York City address 
and find out more information about this location through the NYC Open Data 311 database.


Use Case

NeighborWho is useful in that it allows users to learn more about a specific location using
data about complaint calls to the NYC 311 hotline.  These are not urgent 911 calls and can be 
potentially more illustrative of the day-to-day annoyances and goings-on in a neighborhood, data
that is not often readily available to potential renters/buyers or current residents in NYC.


Design

NeighborWho was designed to be minimalist with a clean UX including only the necessary components to quickly
learn specific information about a specific location.  Given the utilitarian focus, NeighborWho might seem bare
but will give users a quick and efficient resource for learning more about a NYC neighborhood.


Technical

NeighborWho runs using the following:
 - Front-end: Javascript, HTML5, CSS3
 - Back-end: AJAX, Javascript

NeighborWho is fully responsive using Bootstrap responsive grid system and made interactive with jQuery
